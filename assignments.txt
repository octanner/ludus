There are two simple assignments that you will need to complete:

1. fix the launch_google_spec so it will pass.  (/spec/google/test/launch_google_spec.rb)

2. finish the script that does a google search for Muramasa.
    a. Find the wikipedia result and click it.
    b. On the wikipedia page capture his birthdate.
    c. Print Muramasa's birthday to the console.

3. fix the launch_octanner_spec to validate the page loaded. (/spec/octanner/test/launch_octanner_spec.rb)

4. Write a new test that validates the copywrite in the footer is correct and links you to the legal page.

(Bonus)

5. Come up with your own test for the OCTanner home page.

****** Do your best to complete these assignments and email the changes back to us. ******

Note: The readme file will help you get the project up and running.
